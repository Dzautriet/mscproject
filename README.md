Please
- download data from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LiEqIyZbTOmNKRDHgt-qxTQgyGkJl0Jn?usp=sharing);
- save them as `./mnist/X.npy` and `./mnist/y.npy`;
- run `reg_main_4.py` to reproduce results;
- go to line 90+ to modify hyperparameters.

Good luck!

***
`reg_main_2.py` *is now deprecated. Two-stage gradient update becomes the default option from this update.*
